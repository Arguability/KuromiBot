We have moved to an [organization](https://github.com/KuromiBot), which hosts the [new repository](https://github.com/KuromiBot/KuromiBot). This is part of the rewrite because I (the author) love `discord.js` more than `discord.py`, with a better license, and better framework for more features. [Read this for more information](https://github.com/KuromiBot/KuromiBot/discussions/1).
